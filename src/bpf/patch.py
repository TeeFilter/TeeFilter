# Opcode 0x18 (load double word immediate) is the only BPF instruction that
# is 16 byte long. CertrBPF expects the second "pseudo instruction" to have
# opcode 0x10 instead of 0x0 as defined in the specification.
# https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/bpf/instruction-set.html#instruction-encoding
# For this reason, we replace 0x0 in the pseudo-instruction with 0x10.
